# Welcome to Sitecake!

Sitecake is an easy to use CMS (Content Managament System) for small websites, with a WYSIWYG, drag&drop editor.
A standard web hosting packet (a web server and PHP 5.4+) is all you need to install and use it.

For more info, instructions and documentation check the [Wiki](http://github.com/sitecake/sitecake/wiki).
